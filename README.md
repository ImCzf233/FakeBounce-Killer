# 为什么创建这个项目 
# Why build this project
>很多国人开发者并不遵守开源协议。在使用他人成果时不做出任何贡献。为此我们将对他们的程序作出处理。

> Many Chinese developers do not abide by the open source agreement. Make no contribution when using the results of others. To this end, we will deal with their procedures.

>针对LiquidBounce这个开源项目(GPLv3)，原开发者要求在使用他们代码的时候必须对自己的修改产物进行开源。

> For the open source project liquidbource (GPLv3), the original developers required to open source their modified products when using their code.

>纵观整个方块人二开Bounce，仅有FDP Client&LiquidBouncePlus做到了真正遵守协议

> As far as I am concerned, only FDP client & liquidbounceplus has truly complied with the agreement.

>大部分人加上验证进行售卖，但并未向用户开源，这严重违反了开源者的初衷。

> Most people sell with verification, but they don't open source to users, which is a serious violation of the original intention of the source.

>现在我们将对这些客户端进行破解或其他阻止其继续违规行为的操作。

> Now we will crack these clients or other operations to prevent them from continuing their violations.
