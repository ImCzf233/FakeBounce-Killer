# Bounce-Killer
 Eliminate publicly distributed and illegally sold versions of LiquidBounce without source code. \
 Any LiquidBounce fork/modified version that does not comply with open-source agreement will get cracked / its source leaked.
## Most importantly,
 Please notice that the original LiquidBounce project is publicized and licensed under GPLv3, which does NOT allow anyone to sell/distribute softwares without disclosing their source.
 
Original LiquidBounce GitHub repository: https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce \
GNU General Public License version 3: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html

## EN: Why did we create this repository?
- Many Chinese "developers" do not abide by the open-source license, making no contribution when using the results of others. To this end, we will deal with their procedures.
- According to the original LiquidBounce (GPLv3), the developers required people to disclose their modified products' source when using their code.
- As far as I am concerned, only FDPClient and LiquidBouncePlus has truly complied with the license.
- Most people sell private LiquidBounce builds with built-in verification without disclosing source to their users, which is a serious violation of the original intention of the source.
- Our goal is to crack these builds/versions or perform other actions to prevent them from continuing their violations.

## CN: 为什么创建这个项目 
- 很多国人开发者并不遵守开源协议。在使用他人成果时不做出任何贡献。为此我们将对他们的程序作出处理。
- 针对LiquidBounce这个开源项目(GPLv3)，原开发者要求在使用他们代码的时候必须对自己的修改产物进行开源。
- 纵观整个方块人二开Bounce，仅有FDPClient&LiquidBouncePlus做到了真正遵守协议
- 大部分人加上验证进行售卖，但并未向用户开源，这严重违反了开源者的初衷。
- 现在我们将对这些客户端进行破解或其他阻止其继续违规行为的操作。

### It is worth mentioning that we will by all means give our respects to LiquidBounce and its contributors.
