# Bounce-Killer
 Eliminate publicly distributed and illegally sold versions of LiquidBounce without source code. \
 Any LiquidBounce fork/modified version that does not comply with open-source agreement will get cracked / its source leaked.
## Most importantly,
 Please notice that the original LiquidBounce project is publicized and licensed under GPLv3, which does **NOT** allow anyone to **sell/distribute** softwares without **disclosing their source**.
 
Original LiquidBounce GitHub repository: https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce \
GNU General Public License version 3: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html

## Why did we create this repository?
- Many "developers" do not abide by the open-source license, making no contribution when using the results of others. To this end, we will deal with their procedures.
- According to the original LiquidBounce (GPLv3), the developers required people to disclose their modified products' source when using their code.
- As far as I am concerned, only [FDPClient](https://github.com/UnlegitMC/FDPClient) , [LiquidBouncePlus](https://github.com/WYSI-Foundation/LiquidBouncePlus) and [LiquidBouncePlusReborn](https://github.com/liquidbounceplusreborn/LiquidbouncePlus-Reborn) has truly complied with the license.
- Most people sell private LiquidBounce versions with built-in verification without disclosing source to their users, which is a serious violation of the original intention of the source.
- Our goal is to crack these builds/versions or perform other actions to prevent them from continuing their violations.
