## Additional libraries
### Mixins
Mixins can be used to modify classes at runtime before they are loaded. LiquidBounce++ is using it to inject its code into the Minecraft client. This way, we do not have to ship Mojang's copyrighted code. If you want to learn more about it, check out its [Documentation](https://docs.spongepowered.org/5.1.0/en/plugin/internals/mixins.html).
