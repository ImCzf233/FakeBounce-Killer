4. Open the folder as a Gradle project in your IDE.
5. Select the Forge run configuration.

## Additional libraries
### Mixins
Mixins can be used to modify classes at runtime before they are loaded. FDPClient uses it to inject its code into the Minecraft client. This way, we do not have to ship Mojangs copyrighted code. If you want to learn more about it, check out its [Documentation](https://docs.spongepowered.org/5.1.0/en/plugin/internals/mixins.html).

## Contributing
We are welcome for your contributing, but you have to follow these rules to make us merge your pull request.

### Language and Code Quality
First of all, your code at least can be build, and make bugs as less as you can!   
And we want to use kotlin features to make coding easier and faster, please use kotlin and make the [Detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) code quality check good and use kotlin features if you can **\***, we never merge shitcode.

#### Kotlin features
Usage of kotlin features and help enhance the code readability    
kotlin feature examples
~~~kotlin
Timer().schedule(2000L) { 
    // your code
}
~~~
not using kotlin feature
~~~kotlin
Timer().schedule(object : TimerTask(){
    override fun run() {
        // your code
    }
},2000L)
~~~

### Skid codes
Please use original code if you can, and no direct code steals, but we welcome skid using packet logger or anything else like that to skid from a close source and make the cheating community more open!

### Useless features
Useless features means feature only you think its usable ,or feature can be have with config change.  
Like the "TimerSpeed" option to InfiniteAura, this feature can be added with bind Timer to the key with InfiniteAura, or use macro system in FDP Client.
